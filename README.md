# WeatherStation noscreen
Using RaspberryPi  and some sensors to read and show fridge and freezer temperatures, outdoor and indoor temperature, barometric pressure and humidity. All measurements are sent to a database using a short and a longterm storage table. Shortterm is last 24 hours with measurments each 10 seconds and longterm is 'forever' with a longer time between measurements.
Next step is to implement a 'viewer' as an android app that should be run on and old smartphone with only wlan access.
